# {{< icon name="question-circle" pack="far" >}} About the lab
Welcome to the website of the Machine-learning Artificial Intelligence Neuro Imaging Focusing on Longevity & Dementia (MANIFOLD) Laboratory. We are based at University College London, part of the [Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) and the [Dementia Research Centre (DRC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/drc/) at the Institute of Neurology.

# {{< icon name="rocket" pack="fas" >}} Mission Statement
Our goal is to further our understanding of how the brain ages and how this affects risk of cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases and dementia. We do this using advanced statistics, machine learning and AI methods to analyse neuroimaging data, alongside genetic, cognitive, clinical, biological and behavioural information â€“ taking a big-data science approach to help translate computational methods into the clinic for people with age-associated cognitive decline, dementia and related conditions.
