During my Ph.D., I developed machine learning models to address specific problems in computational psychiatry due to biological and clinical heterogeneity in order to identify relevant stratification biomarkers for different disorders. Research I am currently doing involves modeling brain aging and dementia using generative nonlinear methods.
