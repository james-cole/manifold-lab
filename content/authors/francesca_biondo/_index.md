With a strong foundation in experimental design across cognitive science, neuroimaging, and neuropsychology, my research has evolved towards the analysis of large, multimodal medical datasets. My primary aim is to identify key features within these datasets — particularly neuroimaging markers — that can predict disease states or cognitive abilities, thereby enhancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Currently, I focus on neurodevelopmental data, aiming to detect early neuroimaging markers associated with future cognitive development. Additionally, I am investigating the use and reliability of ultra-low-field MRI neuroimaging. Served as the lead researcher on the [BARCODE project](https://manifold-lab.netlify.app/project/barcode/).
