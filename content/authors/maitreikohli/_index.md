My academic background is rooted in experimental design, spanning cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological sciences. In recent years, my research has shifted towards the exploration of large, multimodal medical datasets. My aim is to identify key features within these datasets — particularly those related to neuroimaging — that can predict disease states and potentially contri
