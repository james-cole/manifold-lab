Florence Townend is a PhD student at University College London, enrolled in the AI Enabled Healthcare CDT at the Institute of Health Informatics and based in the Centre for Medical Imaging Computing (CMIC).
Her work is on deep-learning based multimodal data fusion methods for predicting prognosis of Motor Neuron Disease patients using brain MRI and other data sources. 
She made a Python package, Fusilli, which is a toolkit to compare diverse multimodal data fusion models for predictive tasks. It offers an array of models for tabular-tabular and tabular-image data fusion, operating as an efficient pipeline for training and evaluating models across binary, multi-class, and regression tasks. Here is a link to the [Read the Docs](https://fusilli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/florencejt/fusilli).
