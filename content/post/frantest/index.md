Members of the MANIFOLD Lab* presented our ongoing dementia research to the public during an open day organised by Alzheimer's UK. Through interactive activities, we engaged attendees with our work using brain-age and normative modelling, highlighting how these approaches can contribute to the understanding, diagnosis and prognosis of dementia.
