Dementia Awareness Day for the London Chinese Community
On the 28th of June, Dr Jess Jiang (UCL Dementia Research Centre) and Anthi Papouli (UCL Hawkes Institute and member of the MANIFOLD lab) organised a full-day event for the local Chinese community featuring different talks and activities, all with the main goal of providing information on dementia and brain health. 

The day featured the following talks:
- ‘Introduction to Dementia’ – Dr Jess Jiang
- ‘Understanding Parkinson’s disease dementia and Parkinson’s research at UCL’ – Dr Sabrina Kalam (UCL Dementia Research Centre)
- ‘Cognitive Stimulation Therapies: An Overview of Treatments for Mild to Moderate Dementia’ – Dr Esther Hui (UCL Division of Psychiatry)
-	‘Alzheimer’s Disease: from genetics to treatments’ – Dr Maryam Shoai (UCL Institute of Neurology)
- We also had an amazing Sensory Stimulation Exercises session led by Zoe Chan (Ebenezer Holistic Services).
- We featured booths of services and research including ones from the MANIFOLD lab, Dementia Research Centre, Rare Dementia Support, ‘Photos at the Table’ (Ming Zhu, UCL), Ebenezer Holistic Services, Chinese Welfare Trust and UK Dementia Trials Network. 
- Finally, we finished the day with a Q&A session with Professor Jason Warren (UCL Dementia Research Centre) and Dr Miguel Rosa-Grilo (UCL Dementia Research Centre). 

With 52 attendees coming to the event, our anonymous feedback indicated that 100% of respondents found that the event met their expectations and that it was helpful.
Through pre and post surveys, results showed: 
-	9% increase on dementia knowledge using the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale, led largely by a 23% increase on the ‘risk and health promotion’ sub-scale
-	19% increase in respondents agreeing with the statement ‘I feel comfortable discussing dementia with friends and family’
-	21% increase in respondents agreeing with the statement ‘I would know what to do if I was concerned about my cognitive health in the UK’ 
-	50% increase in respondents agreeing with the statement ‘There are support services available in the UK that I can access if I or someone I know gets a diagnosis of dementia’
-	20% increase in respondents agreeing with the statement ‘I would be interested in participating in research relating to dementia’ 
Further, 92% of respondents indicated that they would be interested in attending another dementia awareness event. 

Throughout the day, we had a brilliant team of volunteers who helped make the event possible – whether through translating, general coordination and background support.
